# Step 1: Build the application with Maven
FROM maven:3.8.4-openjdk-17 AS builder

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Maven project files to the container
COPY pom.xml .
COPY src ./src

# Build the Spring Boot application (skip tests to speed up the build if not needed)
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Step 2: Use a lightweight JDK image to run the application
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the JAR file from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar

# Expose port 8080 for the application
EXPOSE 8080

# Set the command to run the JAR file
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
